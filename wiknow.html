            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                We created WiKnow for those moments when you find yourself at the wine shop, paralyzed, wondering what the difference is between Merlot and Mourvedre. We saw a product gap in the wine space that would give beginners easily digestible information and help them select wines to pair with food. Google was sometimes too vague - pair red wine with red meat - and asking for help at the shop can be intimidating. How could we create a solution that was not only approachable, but demystifies the world of wine for beginners? Scroll to learn more about how we did just that.
            </p>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>
                The objective of this project was to design an app that gives beginner wine drinkers an easy, approachable tool to find wine pairings and expand their wine knowledge.
            </p>
            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>
                My role on this project was one of three user experience designers responsible for user research, ideation, design, and testing over a three week period.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <div class="row container col-lg-12 col-med-12 col-sm-12">
                <p>
                    We began by conducting five user interviews of beginner wine drinkers to understand (1) what tools and resources they use to find a food and wine pairing and (2) what they consider when choosing a wine to pair with food.

                    Here's what they had to say:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row container">
                <div class="quote col-lg-6 col-med-6 col-sm-12">
                    <p>
                        “I struggle choosing wines due to my limited knowledge of them.” - Jeff, 56
                    </p> 
                </div>
                <div class="quote col-lg-6 col-med-6 col-sm-12">
                    <p>
                        “I would like to get better at wine pairing, but don't know where to begin.” - Scott, 31
                    </p> 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row container col-lg-12 col-med-12 col-sm-12">
                <p>
                    We discovered beginner wine drinkers need an easy, approachable resource to help them select a wine to pair with food because they don't have a good knowledge of wine yet, but want to learn more. 

                    Using the insights gained from user interviews, we created a user persona to help us empathize with our users.
                </p>

                        But first, do other solutions like this already exist? We performed a competitor analysis to find out.

                        A handful of apps and websites exist that solved a similar problem, but most of them were not created with beginners in mind. The information was way over our users heads, and we wanted to make sure our users weren’t intimidated from the start. We also found that the tools were not easy to use and we had trouble finding the pairing feature.

                        Our solution would focus on beginners and the right level of information that would be valuable to them, not too simple, but not too complex.

                        Our team brainstormed on how we might do this, and landed on three key features that would be most valuable and feasible within the scope of the project:

                    <li>
                        A food / wine pairing feature so our users could easily find a wine pairing for their meals;

                    <li>
                        A 'learn more' button where they could get beginner level wine education; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Easy navigation.

                To guide our wireframe designs, we created a simple user flow to understand how our users would navigate the app.

                        In order to determine if we had solved our user's problem, we conducted three user tests to answer the following questions:
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Can users navigate through the wine pairing flow to find a wine pairing for their meal?

                    <li>
                        Are users able to navigate to the learn more page?
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Key findings from our testing include:
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Our app was easy to navigate; all users were able to find a wine pairing for their meal and navigate to the learn more page;

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Users wanted the ability to save wines to their favorites.

The most important update for our users was a 'my favorites' feature so users could save wines they had enjoyed for easy future reference. We updated our user experience flow and final prototype accordingly.

                    If given more time, I would like to continue testing of our hi-fidelity prototype as well as refine the branding and UI elements. Additionally, I would add features that we identified during our brainstorming which were outside the scope of this project, such as:
                </p>
                <li>
                    Add specific wine bottles to recommendations including pricing information and user reviews;

                <li>
                    Add a link to where user can buy the wine; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a scan label feature.
